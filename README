app-UI
--------------------------------------

app-UI is a collection of user interface components that may be helpful to web and mobile developers for creating interactive applications using HTML and JavaScript, especially those targeting mobile devices.  app-UI is a continual work in progress - it was born out of the necessity to have rich & native-feeling interfaces in HTML/JS experiences, and it works great with PhoneGap applications (http://www.phonegap.com).  app-UI can easily be styled/customized using CSS.

Disclaimer: Please keep in mind that things will change as the project is improved and matured - this is a beta/early prototype.

All of app-UI was created using HTML, CSS, & JavaScript.   All animations are rendered using CSS3 translate3d, so that they are hardware accelerated (where supported).  app-UI works well on iOS, Android and BlackBerry browsers (others not tested), and works well on most desktop browsers as well.

--------------------------------------

app-UI currently has three application containers:

*ViewNavigator* 
The ViewNavigator component allows you to create mobile experiences with an easily recognizable mobile UI paradigm.  You use this to push & pop views from the stack.

*SplitViewNavigator*
The SplitViewNavigator component allows you to create tablet experiences with an easily recognizable mobile UI paradigm.  The SplitViewNavigator allows you to have side-by-side content in the landscape orientation, and the sidebar is hidden in portrait orientation.

*SlidingView*
The SlidingView allows content to slide to the side using a horizontal swipe gesture, revealing a navigation container "underneath".   This is very similar to the behavior in Facebook's iPad application.
